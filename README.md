Banker's Algorithm Web Application
Overview
This repository contains a web application that demonstrates the Banker's Algorithm, used to manage resources in operating systems and prevent deadlock situations. The application provides an interactive interface for users to input process and resource data, and it calculates and displays whether the system is in a safe state.

Features
Input the number of processes and resources.
Dynamically generate input fields for the Allocation Matrix, Maximum Matrix, and Available Resources.
Compute the Need Matrix and determine if the system is in a safe state.
Display the safe sequence if the system is in a safe state or indicate if the system is in deadlock.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the web application.
CSS: Styles the web application for a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles user input, performs calculations for the Banker's Algorithm, and updates the DOM dynamically.
